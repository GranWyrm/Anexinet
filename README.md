##Remember

Upload your file to a github or bitbucket public repo and share it with us. If
you haven't used git before, zip it and send it via email.

You should solve at least 5 of the questions. Feel free to solve all 7 though.

You have 1 business day to send this test answered back to us.
If you need more time please contact the recruitment team to negotiate a
completion date and time.

Please solve this test using the base programming language of the job opening
you are applying for. E.g.:

* Angular positions: Javascript
* .NET positions: C#
* Xamarin positions: C#
* If solving in Javascript: Use of external libraries is NOT allowed.
* If solving in Java or C#: Only use APIs that belong to each language's SDK
* Good code comments are encouraged.
* Creating an interface to run all the scripts is optional (node console, web page, titanium app, etc.)
* Don't forget to tell us in your email how much time you spent on this test and if you have any feedback around it, weâ€™re happy to hear you.

##Test
1. Write a function that receives a String parameter and returns how many vowels
that string has.
2. Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.
3. Write a function that prints out an array containing all permutations of a
given string. Consider a test string abcdefg .
Case "a" prints ["a"]
Case "ab" prints ["ab", "ba"]
4. Write a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of
repeated characters; e.g "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3" . If the
compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, just print
the original string.
5. Write a function that receives a positive number(integer) as a parameter and
then it prints the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same
number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
6. Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to
each other.
7. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.
Good Luck!
